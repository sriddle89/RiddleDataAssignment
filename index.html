<h1> Two Schools Under One Roof: A Tale of Segregation in NYC </h1>
<h2> By Safiyah Riddle
  </section>
<div class="body">
  <section class="lede paragraph">
<p>Two public elementary schools have shared a building for decades, but that appears to be where the commonalities end. Five years after Manhattanâ€™s School District 1 pioneered an integration plan for its highly segregated public elementary schools, using a $1.25 million state grant, the socioeconomic demographics of the two schools remain largely unchanged.
</p>
<p>School district one spans across the Lower East Side of Manhattan, East Village, and Chinatown, encapsulating a socioeconomically diverse swath of Manhattan. While the students who enter the building at 600 East 6th Street are representative of the district as a whole, once they walk through the front doors, the two schools that inhabit the building look starkly different.</p>
<p>On the one hand, PS 64 is only 4.1% white, with a majority of students (72.1%) identified as Hispanic and 18% as Black. Conversely, the Earth school is 29% white, 40% hispanic, and 12% Black, with a sizable Asian (6.5%) and multiracial (11.4%) population as well.

<section class="second paragraph">
<p> The most jarring discrepancies are economic. Though the schools have comparable funding at the City, State, and Federal level, there are substantial discrepancies in how much various PTAs are able to fundraise. In 2019, the latest year that data was available, the Earth School raised approximately $116,000. PS 64 raised only $5,700.

 <p>As the Adams administration vehemently defends its position on selective admissions testing for middle and high schools, in spite of accusations that these screenings perpetuate socioeconomic segregation, elementary school segregation remains largely unresolved. For P.S 64 and the Earth School, unlike middle and high schools, there are no admissions exams or differences in resources allocated by the City.
